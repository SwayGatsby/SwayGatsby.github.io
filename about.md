Hi - I'm Kayla; a 30-something career changer. I've spent my whole adult life working in the third-sector but have decided to retrain in software development. I'm currently learning Ruby, HTML/CSS, Python and soon to be moving on to JavaScript and Java.

I love learning new things so please get in touch if you have any great tips, tutorials or advice!
