I'm Kayla; a 30-something career changer. I've spent my entire adult life working in the third-sector. I loved it but it not being intellectually challenged means the days felt long and dull. After my first play-around with coding, I immediately saw the potential it held for creative logic and I got very excited! So much so that I have decided to retrain in software development. I'm currently enrolled in CodeClan's intensive development course and learning Ruby, HTML/CSS (soon to be moving on to JavaScript and Java).

I love learning new things so please get in touch if you have any great tips, tutorials or advice!
