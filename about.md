Hi, I'm Kayla; a 30-something career changer. I've spent my entire adult life working in the third sector helping charities and ethical businesses scale up and strengthen their social impact. It has been morally fulfilling and aligned perfectly with my values but it wasn't a natural fit for my INTP personality type and I began looking for an outlet where my creativity and logic would be an asset.

Last year I attended a DjangoGirls workshop and absolutely loved it! It led me down a code rabbit-hole; from Coursera to Codecademy to CodeClan and local Meetup groups.

After a lot of contemplation (and sheer panic) I've decided to take the leap and pursue development as a career. To facilitate an actual career change, I'm currently undertaking CodeClan's intensive full-time course which aims to take students from novices to junior devs in 16 weeks.

I'm not yet certain how I'd like to apply my new skills but I have a keen interest in the tech for good movement and my ultimate goal is to contribute to an organisation that is helping to make the world a little better with every release.

Please do get in touch if you want to know more or if you have any advice or tutorials that you've found helpful!
