For the last year or so I've been learning to code in my spare time. It all started after I saw someone write a simple web scraper in a really cool way (collating rescue dogs available from local charities). It was the first time I realised how creative and practical it could be and I wanted to be able to do it! I got a flight to Belfast and attended a one-day workshop with DjangoGirls where I got to use Python the Django web framework to create a microblog from scratch. Since then I've been seeking out different resources and have dabbled in Python, Ruby and HTML/CSS. It has been a challenge but I've enjoyed it and after a lot of consideration and sheer panic I decided to go all in and pursue it full time.

Today was my first day at CodeClan's intensive development course which aims to take novices to junior developer level in 16 weeks. Most of the day was full of housekeeping; agreeing to the code of conduct, creating a set of rules for our own cohort and meeting our instructors. In the afternoon we got an introduction to terminal commands and Git/Git Hub. I was pretty familiar with everything we discussed which, for someone who always feels anxious about not knowing enough, was a welcome relief.

The rest of the week will be covering some basic Ruby syntax and I'm really looking forward to getting stuck in to coding.
